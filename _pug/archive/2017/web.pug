    p An ongoing drawing project to see what’s possible with CSS. Each drawing is a single HTML element (the beloved div) and a whole bunch of styles.
    blockquote.small Wonderfully creative use of CSS gradients, borders, box-shadows, and generated content.

    p Every airport has a unique three-letter IATA code. Some make sense if you know the city or the name of the airport and others, well, what the heck? Turns out there’s usually a reasonable explanation.
    P The site features over 1000 airports and includes an airport from every country that has one.

    p WhyAZ is a little web project that resulted from asking questions about attracting and keeping talent in Arizona. We spend a lot of time building up and promoting our brands and projects, but we spend little time talking about Arizona. Our state has a lot to offer and so #[a(href='http://why.az') why.az] was born.
    p To make it even more fun, I thought it might be neat if we designed the site completely in browser, drawing our graphical elements in CSS while maintaining clean, semantic markup.
    p To read more about the approach, check out this blog post: #[a(href='http://blog.meltmedia.com/2013/08/why-whyaz/') Why WhyAZ?]
    p At the time of that post, each illustration consisted of two HTML elements. But now, each illustration is one glorious single div.
    p To see the many many examples we've made (and to learn more about our great state), visit #[a(href='https://why.az') why.az] or #[a(href='https://github.com/whyaz/whyaz') contribute via GitHub].

    p Have you ever noticed how in movies young actresses are often cast as the love interests of #[em much] older leading men? Buzzfeed even wrote an article #[a(href='https://www.buzzfeed.com/andyneuenschwander/if-hollywood-age-gaps-were-gender-swapped') poking fun at the Hollywood age gap].
    p Male actors are regularly cast alongside love interests 10-30 years their junior. And on the flipside, in the most ubiquitous film example of a man dating an older woman, #[em The Graduate], Anne Bancroft was only 6 years older than Dustin Hoffman.
    p Hollywood Age Gap examines the age difference between movie love interests. Check it out and judge for yourself if Hollywood has an age problem.
