    p Have you ever noticed how in movies young actresses are often cast as the love interests of #[em much] older leading men? Buzzfeed even wrote an article #[a(href='https://www.buzzfeed.com/andyneuenschwander/if-hollywood-age-gaps-were-gender-swapped') poking fun at the Hollywood age gap].
    p Male actors are regularly cast alongside love interests 10-30 years their junior. And on the flipside, in the most ubiquitous film example of a man dating an older woman, #[em The Graduate], Anne Bancroft was only 6 years older than Dustin Hoffman.
