    Lately for work and for my portfolio, I‚Äôve been making complex SVG illustrations that require a lot of fine-grained control once implemented. Colors change, layers show and hide, and animations run based on various user input.

    A tedious part of that process has been prepping the SVG after exporting it from Illustrator. Some things are updated manually, some with the [RegReplace](https://css-tricks.com/run-multiple-find-replace-commands-sublime-text/) plugin in Sublime Text, and some with optimization tools like [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo).

    It would be cool and useful if some of this work could happen when the SVG is initially exported. I know it‚Äôs a forever problem making design software‚Äôs output more closely resemble developers‚Äô output, but SVG is already there! Just a few more export controls would be a big win, imo.

    So here‚Äôs a list of options I would love to see:

    **1. Export layer names as classes.** <br>
    Illustrator only supports exporting layer names as `id`. And then to avoid multiples of the same `id`, Illustrator will do this:

    ```
      <path id="card">...</path>
      <path id="card-1" data-name="card">...</path>
      <path id="card-2" data-name="card">...</path>
    ```

    This requires some find-and-replace that takes a couple steps. I‚Äôd much prefer it output like this:

    ```
      <path class="card">...</path>
      <path class="card">...</path>
      <path class="card">...</path>
    ```

    **2. Namespaced output.** <br>
    If we‚Äôre doing classes, it might also be cool if we could namespace things. Using the artboard name + layer name makes sense here. Maybe it could output like this:

    ```svg
      <svg id="birthday">
        <path class="card birthday-card">...</path>
        <path class="byline birthday-byline">...</path>
      </svg>
    ```

    Or maybe just like this:

    ```svg
      <svg id="birthday">
        <path class="birthday-card">...</path>
        <path class="birthday-byline">...</path>
      </svg>
    ```

    **3. Export with CSS custom properties.** <br>
    The most obvious case here is theming like light and dark modes. Instead of hex colors, I often want `fill` and `stroke` to be something like `var(--bg-color)` or `var(--text-color)`. Or `currentColor` would be great sometimes, too.

    Maybe color swatches could have one more setting for a custom property name and the SVG export could toggle that on or off.

    **4. Add `<title>` and `<description>` at artboard level.** <br>
    Illustrator lets you add them at document level, but not artboard. And at least for my workflow, I really don‚Äôt want to maintain multiple files of source artwork.

    **5. Optimize on export.** <br>
    An SVGO integration or something similar makes sense here. Would be great if it was a bit smart. So if you‚Äôve set a `<title>` for your artboard, the option to strip out the `<title>` would be unselected automatically, etc.

    **6. Set custom width and height.** <br>
    Illustrator does have a checkbox to export a responsive SVG, but this actually removes the `width` and `height` attributes. I usually want to set them to `100%`.

    **7. Toggle other SVG properties.** <br>
    Not as common a need, but might be nice to add things like `preserveAspectRatio` or `vector-effect` with a checkbox on export.

    Having these options would rule and make my work a lot easier.

    I know Figma has plugins that help with some of these. [SVG Export](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/814345141907543603/svg-export) provides a way to do `currentColor` and to export with layer names as classes. Nice. [Advanced SVG Export](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/782713260363070260) uses SVGO to optimize on export. Also nice!

    But to be honest, doing vector work in Figma is extremely not fun for me! Maybe someday. In the meantime, Adobe, let‚Äôs do this.
