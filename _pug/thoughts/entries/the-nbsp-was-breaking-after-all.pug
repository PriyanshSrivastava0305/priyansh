  :markdown-it(html)

    I’d been meaning to migrate [my blog](https://lynnandtonicblog.com) off [wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com) for a long time. I set it up in 2009 and while I still love the ease of not having to maintain a Wordpress install, lots of little things were nudging me to move to something else.

    I didn’t have much control over the code, which became less of a positive the more my skills and competing tech advanced. To make the changes I could, I had to pay for a plan and a custom CSS upgrade. It wasn’t a ton of money, but enough to make me question things each time renewal rolled around. And occasionally the theme I was using would get deprecated and I’d need to choose and customize a different one. But moving over a decade of posts was enough work for me to stay put.

    The thing that tipped it ended up being a non-breaking space. It’s always something tiny, right?

    For a long time, Wordpress has injected a `&nbsp;` between the last two words of longer headlines to avoid a widow if the headline wraps. Not sure for how long or if isolated to wordpress.com, but Wordpress was also injecting the `&nbsp;` into the `<meta name="twitter:text:title">` for social previews. 

    This doesn’t seem to affect things on Twitter, but I’ve moved from Twitter to Mastodon and it does affect things there. The social preview for a recent post was rendering like this on pretty much every Mastodon app I checked:

    <img src='/assets/images/thoughts/nbsp-noooo.jpg' width='1200' height='467' alt='screenshot with social image and the title says “My favorite movies of&nbsp;2022”' />

    I talked with wordpress.com customer support and a few Wordpress devs on Mastodon. It wasn’t something I could fix on my own, so a bug was filed. I didn’t expect it to be a priority. I really didn’t want my social previews to look like this and it made me not want to post. So that felt like enough reason to move things, at least temporarily.

    ## Choosing Eleventy

    I’d also been meaning to try out [Eleventy (11ty)](https://www.11ty.dev/) on a personal project. [Zach Leatherman](https://www.zachleat.com/) is the coolest and so many folks I admire sing Eleventy’s praises. Besides not injecting an unremovable `&nbsp;` into my social previews, Eleventy had some nice benefits:

    - Full control over the code and templates
    - A static site that will ship way less code to the browser
    - Eliminate the additional costs I was paying

    There were a few downsides:

    - I’d lose years of comments I didn’t plan to move over (probably fine and I could potentially add Webmentions in the future)
    - A bit more friction for posting (Wordpress GUI is nice)
    - I’d lose search (more on this later)

    I decided to go for it! */me fist pumping*

    ## The process

    First I exported my blog content from wordpress.com. They give you a giant XML file. I used [this article](https://daext.com/blog/convert-wordpress-articles-to-markdown/) and [this script](https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown) to convert the XML to Markdown. Worked great!

    I then started moving the content into [eleventy-base-blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog). I tried to make it match as closely as possible to my Wordpress template. Wordpress has a bit of a unique vibe so there were a few challenges.

    ### URL generation
    Wordpress generates post URLs with the date and then post title like this `/2023/02/23/this-is-the-post-title/`. I didn’t want to structure my post directory like this, so I decided to use [permalink](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/permalinks/). The data export did give me a `<link>` with the full post URL, but I wanted to try and set things up so old and new posts could use the same stuff and I didn’t have to duplicate data in the front matter. I created an Eleventy filter that formatted the `date` this way:

    ```
    eleventyConfig.addFilter("pathDate", dateObj => {
      return DateTime.fromJSDate(dateObj, {zone: 'utc'}).toFormat("yyyy/LL/dd");
    })
    ```

    And then set each post’s front matter like this:

    ```
    title: This is the post title
    date: 2023-02-23
    permalink: /{{ date | pathDate }}/{{ title | slug }}/
    ```

    Another thing Wordpress does is make unique slugs for posts with the same titles even if they are posted on different dates. So a post titled _Howdy partner_ might get a URL like `/2022/05/06/howdy-partner/`. If I published another post a month later also titled _Howdy partner_, the URL would look like this `/2022/06/12/howdy-partner-2/`. So I had to manually make sure those posts were accounted for. Something like this:

    ```
    permalink: /{{ date | pathDate }}/{{ title | slug }}-2/
    ```

    A bit tedious but I got everything working ok.

    ### Tags and categories
    My Wordpress theme was using tags and categories. At one point I think I understood why I made things one or the other. 😅 I ended up consolidating those into just tags and did some cleanup to make things more consistent.

    ### YouTube and other embeds
    The Wordpress data export included YouTube embeds with Wordpress-specific syntax like this: `[youtube=http://youtu.be/VGsRedwDK40]`. I had to change those to the proper YouTube embeds (and Vimeo, Instagram, etc). Also some of the videos were no longer available so I found some replacements mostly for my own sake.

    ### Full post preview
    I liked the era of Wordpress where the blog index pages showed the entire post content so you didn’t have to click into each post. I got that working in Eleventy by using [excerpt](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-frontmatter-customize/#example-parse-excerpts-from-content) and just making the entire post the excerpt? Probably a better way to do that but it worked.

    ### Dates
    I ran into the [dates off by one day](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/dates/#dates-off-by-one-day) issue in a few places. I do not understand timezones! I ended up setting a date and time value separately in the front matter for new posts (with a 9am my time default) and just left off the time for older posts. That seemed to work for what I was doing. Not sure if I’ll run into any issues later, but so far so good.

    ### Moved images
    This isn’t a Wordpress or Eleventy thing, but another task was moving my images from being hosted on [my portfolio](https://lynnandtonic.com) to being hosted with the blog itself. I had originally set it up that way because I was using FTP at the time (ah, memories) and that was easier than using the Wordpress image uploader. This was a helpful decision years later because I just did a nice file move and path replacement locally and didn’t need to do a big download from wordpress.com.

    ### Search
    Remember when I said I would lose search when I moved to a static site? Well say hello to [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/)! I followed [this handy tutorial by Robb Knight](https://rknight.me/using-pagefind-with-eleventy-for-search/) to add Pagefind search to my Eleventy site. Really nice! I tend to think I was the only one using search on my blog but I used it a lot, so happy to have it back in there.

    ## What Next?
    I think I’m going to start moving my portfolio into Eleventy soon. It’s a bit more complicated and has its own decade-long baggage. I’m excited to dig in more and to learn how I could have done things better on the blog. My [blog code is on Github](https://github.com/lynnandtonic/lynnandtonicblog) if you want to take a peek for whatever reason! Shout at me if anything is wonky.

    Overall things went really well with the blog though. I’m liking the setup and the control it offers and I’m doing the blogging I set out to do. Even if wordpress.com does end up fixing that `&nbsp;` issue, I don’t think I’ll go back for now. Big thanks to [wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com) for serving my blog for so many years! And thanks to [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and the 11ty community for the great docs and tutorials!
